# Warning: The contents of `base` and `options` may be replaced.

The contents of the `base` and `options` may be automatically replaced with a file with a similar name in the [vscode-dev-containers](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-dev-containers) repository's [script-library folder](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-dev-containers/tree/main/script-library) whenever the repository is packaged.

However, you can feel free to update `user-install-steps.sh` or add your own script into this folder. The `install` script will automatically run any scripts ending in `.sh` in this folder.
